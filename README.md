# Liver Cirrhosis Stage Detection

This project uses advanced machine learning and data preprocessing techniques to detect the stage of liver cirrhosis based on clinical and lab data.

## Features
- Missing value handling with threshold-based logic
- Categorical encoding and skewness reduction
- Feature interaction and polynomial feature creation
- Advanced feature selection using Random Forest
- Multiple models: Random Forest, SVM, XGBoost, Gradient Boosting
- Ensemble model using soft voting
- Evaluation using Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, ROC-AUC
- Visualizations for EDA and feature importance

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
Install the required libraries:
```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn xgboost
